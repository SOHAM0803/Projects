### Descriptive Summary:
The Bangalore house price prediction project involved creating a machine learning model using **NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn** to process real estate data and predict housing prices. 
To make the model user-friendly, a **website** was developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, allowing users to input details such as location, square footage, and number of rooms.
A **Flask server** was implemented to bridge the front-end UI and the machine learning model. 
Whenever a user submits data on the website, an **HTTP request** is sent to the Flask server, which processes the input, runs the model, and returns the predicted house price.
For deployment, an **AWS Ubuntu instance** was set up to host the project.
Using **WinSCP**, the project files were uploaded to the remote server.
**Git Bash** was used to install necessary dependencies, and a **virtual environment** was configured to ensure the project runs smoothly whenever accessed.
The final setup ensures that the model and website are accessible at scale, making it a real-world solution for predicting Bangalore house prices.
